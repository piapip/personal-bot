[3] Add export/import option for the History tab.

[5] Hit critical performance issue when there are multiple history actions.

[8] Add a repositioning button.

[9] Add template that is loopable.
    [OK] Add the table to the template.
    Add the timer.
    Add the progressbar.
    Add the "Add step" button.
    [OK] Run everything.

[10] Click by value with HTML .

[11] Hotkey for the rename?

[12] Hotkey for the add new tab (ctrl T)?

[13] Put all the cell under the same widget or let the caller render the cell by itself. 

[14] Don't let the UI handle the history_actions.

[15] Maybe I can put the UI component into the Action object.
     Like instead of storing name, value, css,
     it will store the entries that provide those information...
     And I can have multiple funciton like:
       renderActionForActionsTab...
       renderActionForHistoryTab...
     How's that?

[16] Update action before saving.

[17] VERY IMPORTANT!!!
     Remove all list storing actions. Refer to row instead.
     The Remove feature is breaking because of that.
     Also can't save the template because the template's 
     actions are not updated on adding new row.
