[3] Add export/import option for the History tab.

[5] Hit critical performance issue when there are multiple history actions.

[8] Add a repositioning button.

[9] Add template that is loopable.
    [OK] Add the table to the template.
    Add the timer.
    Add the progressbar.
    Run everything.

[10] Click by value with HTML .

[11] Hotkey for the rename?

[12] Hotkey for the add new tab (ctrl T)?

[13] Put all the cell under the same widget or let the caller render the cell by itself. 

[14] Don't let the UI handle the history_actions.

[15] Maybe I can put the UI component into the Action object.
     Like instead of storing name, value, css,
     it will store the entries that provide those information...
     And I can have multiple funciton like:
       renderActionForActionsTab...
       renderActionForHistoryTab...
     How's that?

[16] Update action before saving.
