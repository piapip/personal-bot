[3] Add export/import option for the History tab.

[5] Hit critical performance issue when there are multiple history actions.

[9] Add the timer condition to the template's loop?

[10] Click by value with HTML.
     [OK] Driver logic.
     [OK] Remove the separate column for tab_index.
     Add the thing to the UI.

[11] Hotkey for the rename?

[12] Hotkey for the add new tab (ctrl T)?

[15] Maybe I can put the UI component into the Action object.
     Like instead of storing name, value, css,
     it will store the entries that provide those information...
     And I can have multiple funciton like:
       renderActionForActionsTab...
       renderActionForHistoryTab...
     How's that?

[21] Check this video to do the drag and reposition: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGmMsGOcBB0

[22] There's some Spaghetti in the ScrollableActionTable.
     It can be untangled by making the MoveUp/MoveDown button not depending on the HistoryActionRow.
     But that will create more Spaghetti because my frontend skill sucks :').
     Maybe this is not how I'm supposed to create a table on the UI.
     But then, what's the proper approach?

[23] Make skippable togglable.
